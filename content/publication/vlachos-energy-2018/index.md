abstract: "Millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) systems have recently been proposed to meet the needs of the future wireless communication standards. The efﬁcient use of low resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and hybrid architecture could signiﬁcantly reduce the high power consumption associated with the mmWave MIMO system components. This paper designs an energy efﬁcient transmitter with low resolution DACs for mmWave massive MIMO systems. An optimization problem is formulated and solved to ﬁnd the optimal number of radio-frequency (RF) chains to be used at the transmitter to minimize the power consumption. This problem is constrained by the information loss which introduces the reduction of the number of the RF chains, expressed in terms of the system capacity. Rate and energy performance are compared with different beamforming techniques and architectures for various DAC resolutions."
