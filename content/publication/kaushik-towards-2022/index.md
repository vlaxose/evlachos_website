abstract: "The joint radar‐comm unication (JRC) system is env isioned as an emerging sixth gener- ation (6G) technolog y to tack le spectral congest ion and hardwa re limitations by jointly implementing the communication and radar sensing on the same hardwa re platfor m and using the common radio frequency (RF) resources . J oint radar‐comm unication systems with a mult i‐antenna setup leads to higher deg rees of freedom, and hybr id beamfor ming can be exploited to achiev e low er hardwa re complexity than conv entional fully digital systems . This paper aims to design a spectral efficiency maximisation approach for a 6G inclined JR C system with hybrid beamfor ming and m ulti‐antenna setup while considering the interference between commun ication and radar operations and hardwa re impair ments in the system. The rate expressions for communication and radar operations are defined, and the joint spectral efficiency is maximised via optimising the number of RF chains using an efficient selection alg orithm taking into account the interference of one oper - ation to the other and system hardwa re distor tion."
