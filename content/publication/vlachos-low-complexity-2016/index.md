abstract: "Vehicular communication systems are usually equipped with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transceivers that operate on rapidly changing radio propagation environments, which results in high Doppler and delay spreads. More speciﬁcally, in these environments, the experienced channels are doubly selective and introduce severe intercarrier interference (ICI) at the receiver. An effective ICI mitigation technique is desired as a constituent part of an ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) architecture, which turns out to be computationally efﬁcient, since it may require the solution of linear systems with multiple right-hand sides. To decrease the complexity, several techniques suggest mitigating the ICI by considering only a small number of adjacent subcarriers. However, this approximation introduces an error ﬂoor, which may result in unacceptable bit error rates (BER) at high signal-to-noise ratio regimes. In this paper, we propose a new OSIC equalization technique based on an iterative Galerkin projection-based algorithm that reduces the computational cost without sacriﬁcing the performance gains of the OSIC architecture."
