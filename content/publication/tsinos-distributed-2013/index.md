abstract: "Multi-cell coordinated beamforming (CB) can mit- igate inter-cell interference. However, previous study on CB focuses on systems with only one receive antenna. This paper considers CB for systems with multiple receive antennas. To take fairness among scheduled users into account, CB is designed to maximize the harmonic sum of signal-to-interference-plus- noise ratio (SINR). We develop an iterative algorithm that can guarantee convergence. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm have 70% and 47% throughput gains over single cell beamforming for 10th percentile user throughput and median user throughput, respectively. I. I NTRODUCTION In order to increase the capacity of cellular networks, dense cells can be deployed. For dense cellular networks, the performance is limited by inter-cell interference (ICI). Thus, mitigating ICI has become an important issue. Traditional methods of mitigating ICI is to optimize the transmit power of the cells in time or frequency domain to improve performance of the cell-edge users [1], [2]. Nowadays, improvement in backhaul connection allowed a large amount of information to be shared among base stations (BS) quickly."
