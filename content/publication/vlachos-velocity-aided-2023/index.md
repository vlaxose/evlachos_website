abstract: "This paper focuses on addressing the challenge of estimating multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels for wireless communication between a ground base-station and a moving vehicle. One recently recognised model for time-varying channels incorporates spatial selectivity, which is referred to as beam squint, and is particularly relevant in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) range. In such scenarios, it is essential to account for the beam squint when attempting to recover channel parameters using a training sequence. However, the use of a training sequence alone may be insufficient for this purpose. To overcome this issue, in this work, we propose a channel estimation approach that exploits information provided by the control module of the vehicle, namely its velocity. The estimation problem that is designed, regards the channel both in a parametric and a non-parametric form and the alternating direction method of multipliers is utilised to efficiently solve it. It is demonstrated via simulations that considerable gains can be achieved if information from the control unit of the vehicle can be appropriately introduced and exploited."
