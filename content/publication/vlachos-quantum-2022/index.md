abstract: "Quantum computing (QC)-assisted algorithms promise exponential increase in the computational efficiency, enabling instant solution of large systems of equations. Mas- sive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems pose extraordinary demands in computa- tional complexity, due to the usage of huge antenna arrays, massive number of users, and ultra low-latency requirements. This work provides an initial discussion on how QC-based algorithms for solving linear systems of equations could be utilized for assisting the basic operations of the transceivers physical-layer, such as the channel estimation. We identify the connections between the amplitude encoding in the quantum domain and the recovery of the channel information."
