abstract: "In this paper we propose two new adaptive decision feedback equalization (DFE) schemes for channels with long and sparse impulse responses. It has been shown that for a class of channels, and under reasonable assumptions concerning the DFE ﬁlter sizes, the feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) ﬁlters possess also a sparse form. The sparsity form of both the channel impulse response (CIR) and the equalizer ﬁlters is properly exploited and two novel adaptive greedy schemes are derived. The ﬁrst scheme is a channel estimation based one. In this scheme, the non-negligible taps of the involved CIR are ﬁrst estimated via a new greedy algorithm, and then the FF and FB ﬁlters are adaptively computed by exploiting a useful relation between these ﬁlters and the CIR. The channel estimation part of this new technique is based on the steepest descent (SD) method and offers considerably improved performance as compared to other adaptive greedy algorithms that have been proposed. The second scheme is a direct adaptive sparse equalizer based on a SD-based greedy algorithm."
