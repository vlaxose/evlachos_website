abstract: "Automotive industry will be greatly beneﬁted by the advent of 5G Networking and the huge boost in performance and coverage it will support. Road safety and trafﬁc efﬁciency services will be signiﬁcantly upgraded through seamlessly interconnected devices, while latency decrease will most likely allow autonomous driving to become a commodity, available to everyone. This technology will have a huge societal and economical impact, since it will render severe trafﬁc accidents, long commute times and increased energy consumption obsolete. Current vehicular communication systems are usually equipped with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transceivers that op- erate in suboptimal modes for the upcoming 5G standards. The problem originates in the existing intercarrier interference (ICI) on the receiver end, often partially tackled by integrated successive interference cancellation (OSIC) architectures. How- ever, for decreasing complexity, system designers attempt to mitigate ICI by considering only a small number or sub-carriers, leading to error ﬂoor"
