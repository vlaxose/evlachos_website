abstract: "With the growing demand for easy and reliable generation of 3D models representing real-world or synthetic objects, new schemes for acquisition, storage, and transmission of 3D meshes are required. In principle, 3D meshes consist of vertex positions and vertex connectivity. Vertex position encoders are much more resource demanding than connectivity encoders, stressing the need for novel geometry compression schemes. The design of an accurate and efﬁcient geometry compression system can be achieved by increasing the compression ratio without affecting the visual quality of the object and minimizing the computational complexity. In this paper, we present novel compression/reconstruction schemes that enable aggressive compression ratios, without signiﬁcantly reducing the visual quality. The encoding is performed by simply executing additions/subtractions. The beneﬁts of the proposed method become more apparent as the density of the meshes increases, while it provides a ﬂexible framework to trade efﬁciency for reconstruction quality."
