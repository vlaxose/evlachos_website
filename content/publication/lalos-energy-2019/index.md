abstract: "Many mixed reality applications are b ased on the real-time compression and streaming of three-dimensional (3D) mod­ els. Thus, they demand very high- bandwidth and ultra-low latency from network specifications. The next-generation wireless networks will employ promising technologies to sig­ nificantly improve the communication data rates. However, due to implementation complexity and thus increased en­ ergy consumption of these technologies, a trade-off between the quality-of-use r-experience (QoE) and the hardware spec­ ifications is necessary. To overcome these limitations low- resolution quantizers have been of inte rest, which provide a trade-off between quality and complexity. In this p aper, we propose a complexity-aware perceptual coding scheme that minimizes the reconstruction losses of the 3D models. Ex­ tensive simulations assuming different 3D models show that the proposed scheme achieves plausible reconstruction output offering significantly higher energy efficiency gains, as com­ pared to a context unaware coding approaches."
