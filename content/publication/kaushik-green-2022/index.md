abstract: "This paper considers a multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) joint radar-communication (JRC) transmission with hybrid precoding and low resolution digital to analog converters (DACs). An energy efﬁcient radio frequency (RF) chain and DAC bit selection approach is presented for a sub- arrayed hybrid MIMO JRC system. W e introduce a weighting formulation to represent the combined radar-communications information rate. The presented selection mechanism is incorpo- rated with fractional programming to solve an energy efﬁciency maximization problem for JRC which selects the optimal number of RF chains and DAC bit resolution. Subsequently, a weighted minimization problem to compute the precoding matrices is formulated, which is solved using an alternating minimization approach. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of high energy efﬁciency whilst main- taining good rate and desirable radar beampattern performance.
