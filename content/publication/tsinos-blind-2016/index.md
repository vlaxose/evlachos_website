abstract: "In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed beamforming for maximization of the receiver signal-to-noise­ ratio (SNR) subject to a total transmit power constraint. We investigate the case where the optimal beamforming weights are expressed based on the second-order statistics of the in­ volved channels, while the communication among the relays is interference-limited. In this context, we propose a relay­ cooperative scheme for interference minimization, where only a limited number of correlation quantities are sent to the fusion center (FC). We propose a technique which overcomes the problem of the incomplete covariance matrices via matrix completion. Through simulation results, we show that, after a number of iterations, the proposed technique converges to the true covariance matrices and thus the optimal beamformer may be computed."
