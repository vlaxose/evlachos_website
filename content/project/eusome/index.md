**Role:** Principal Investigator (PI) for ISI/Athena RC.
**Funding:** >800k€ (Horizon Europe).

The **EUSOME** project establishes a "Living Lab" for Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM). We focus on:
1.  **Cooperative Sensing:** Algorithms for UAV swarms to sense the environment collectively.
2.  **Digital Twins:** Real-time synchronization between physical drones and their digital counterparts.
3.  **Experimental Validation:** Using the Aerial Networks Testbed at ISI.

This project bridges the gap between theoretical 6G control algorithms and real-world deployment.
