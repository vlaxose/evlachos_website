**Role:** Principal Investigator (PI).
**Partner:** Hellenic U-Space Industry (HUSI).

SPLASH investigates the **Co-design** of control and communication protocols for U-Space services. Key innovations include:
* [cite_start]**ISAC Waveforms:** Using OTFS/FMCW for simultaneous radar sensing and data transmission[cite: 238].
* [cite_start]**GNSS Resilience:** Navigation solutions for GPS-denied environments using cooperative localization[cite: 233].
* [cite_start]**Risk Modeling:** New frameworks for UAV swarm safety assessment[cite: 239].
